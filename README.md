| status               | varchar | For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details are updated.

For external accounts, possible values are `new` and `errored`. Validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply. If a transfer fails, the status is set to `errored` and transfers are stopped until account details are updated. |

| status                                        | varchar   | Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, or `unpaid`. 

For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this state can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` state. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal state, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated. 

A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over. 

If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically` it becomes `past_due` when payment to renew it fails and `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings) when Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts. 

If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices. |
